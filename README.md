## Objectives

  1. Define a variable.
  2. Create and reassign variables.
  3. Define pass-by-value as it relates to variables.

## Outline

  * Show printing "Barack Obama"
  * What is "Barack Obama"? Oh! It's the current president
  * Wouldn't it be nice if we could explain the context of the data that you have.
  * That's why variables were created. You can make a variable called `currentPresident`
  * then print the currentPresident, change the president whenever you want
  * Mention that "Barack Obama" is a string because of the quotes.
  * variables work like variables in math, they are assigned using the `=` operator
  * can be reasssigned to something else (choose a different name for president, don't choose a real person)
  * Show also that re-assigning matters in the order of operations. So 

  ```
  currentPres = "Obama"
  print(currentPres)
  currentPres = "Daffy"
  print(currentPres)
  ```

  * Include a working swift project with no tests to allow students to play around
